I'm currently an undergraduate Computer Science student at Tribhuvan University. By day, I'm an Audio Producer at PODS by PEI, a weekly policy discussion series. Beyond my studies, my heart lies at the intersection of technology and society, where I delve into the profound impacts that technology etches across our lives, all while pondering its vast implications for society as a whole.

With an insatiable curiosity, I'm driven by the passion to unravel how technological advancements intricately mold our world. My journey involves active participation in discussions/podcasts and immersive research focused on unraveling the societal tapestry woven by emerging technologies.
